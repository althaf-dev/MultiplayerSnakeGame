1. Initial postion of the snake in multiplayer mode is to be corrected

    In multiplayer mode game start without showing initial position of snake .
    After pressing up arrow button it appears.
    

2. The speed of snake is getting increased automatically when a player join back after game over.

        - This is is solved by limiting the call to game engine . Before game engine was called each time player joins
        It is changed to call only if game engine not alredy running. a flag called run is added to this.
